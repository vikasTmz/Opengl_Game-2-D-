What has been implemented?

All the necessary features have been implemented. Projectile motion with
gravity and air resistance,Collision with objects, friction, and movable
objects(the white circular ball);
A customizable block has been placed to help the gamer hit unreachable targets.
A projectile path tracer has been made to help the gamer keep track of the
previous shot's path (like in angry birds).

Image Rendering and Font rendering has been implemented.

NOTE: The font rendering code is causing issues with the frame rate and thus
crashing the application.I've commented out the code for now and porbably show it during the demo.
